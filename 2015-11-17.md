## 11/17/2015 Minutes:
* John updated the discussion with ADS and shared some papers
* Matt introduced the idea of PTM, and discussed possible modifications:
  * add K "junk" topics, filter math concepts (do not be too general)
  * possible library to use: jonathan chang's lda in R, mallet, python package gensim
* We brainstormed about equation embeddings

## To Do:
* experiment on PTM (wiki + arXiv)
  * filter vocabulary to be the intersection of arxiv _and_ wiki
  * try step-by-step approach suggested by Dave
  * filter stat-th wiki categories by intersecting with arxiv keywords
* keep in mind the equation embeddings
* Yuancheng will give an overview of IBP
