## 11/03/2015 Minutes:
* walk John through the last meeting discussion
* John shares some papers:
  * The Abject Failure of Keyword IR for Math Search by Berkeley
  * Math Language Processing by Anddrew Lan in Rice
* discussion about using topic modelling on combined corpus of wiki math concepts pages and arXiv articles
* Matt discussed ideas of possible tasks, including:
  * variable identification dataset: align the variables in the equation with correpoding phrases in the text, Matt showed some interesting samples
  * equation identification dataset: align the equations with the descriptions in the text
* Matt has been working on Solr, which is supposed to be better than MeTA
* Yuancheng reported some equation modelling experiments:
  * generative LSTM model on equations, to get representations of equations (max-pooling of chars)
  * shows some interesting results (found a^2+b^2=c^2 with x^2+y^2=z^2)
  * possible to improve it, given better tokenization
* Hongyuan has been working on ConvNet + LSTM
* Hongyuan gave an overview of the word-embedding paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03520)

## To Do:
* keep in mind some possible working directions:
  * topic modelling on wiki+arXiv; variable+equ identification dataset; equation modelling
* finish ConvNet + LSTM experiment
* investigate whether equations can help text for the tasks, e.g. category classification
