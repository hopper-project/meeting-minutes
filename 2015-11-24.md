## 11/24/2015 Minutes:
* Matt updated the current progress of PTM:
  * arxiv dataset covers 03/11 to 11/15
  * wiki dataset includes all categories under "Statistical Theory"
  * Joint vocabulary has 1880 words
  * showed some examples: using wiki MLE as fixed topics, run posterior inference on arxiv documents and investigate top 5 topics for a random sampling of documents
* Yuancheng gave an overview of Indidan Buffet Process (IBP)

## To Do:
* improve the PTM experiment results:
  * further filter topics + add topics from other wikipedia categories (e.g. multivariate statistics, statistical inference)
  * more iterations of Gibbs sampling for fixed-topic study
  * derive posterior marginal distribution with the inclusion of junk topics. update lda-c code. 
  * use first 500/1000 words in the article instead of the entire article
* brainstorm the equation embeddings
