## Minutes
* MeTA:
  * Matt showed a demo of the search app running the MeTA dev branch, which includes author, title and arxiv link. Need to add category info in the future.
  * Need to host a web server on ood/dalek or Amazon for public access.
*Demacro on entire arxiv:
  * Matt pointed out an issue when running programs on ood/dalek. It seems that the user is subject to a quota if working under the default $home directory. Doesn't have that issue when working under laffertystorage$home.
  * Space needed for demacroing everything is estimated to be ~200G, which shouldn't be an issue. Could also consider processing files without decompressing the tar files.
*Classification:
  * Hongyuan trained a one-layer bidirectional LSTM to classify equations extracted from arxiv papers from Jan 2015 to June 2015 on the top 5 categories. Overall accuracy is ~75% compared to ~50% using generative models. The model performs well on 3 categories (~90% accuracy) but poorly on physics and statistics.
  * Two possibilities for next step: train on more data; visualize the neural network.
* Jaan & latexML:
  * Jaan joined and talked about the latexML project and he would like to sequence to sequence technique on math equations and possibility of utilizing the tree structure of formulae.
  * He will help us set up a thread where we could all ask Deyan Ginev (a co-developer of latexML) about the about latexML.
  * latexML seems to be maintained well under its github repo. It comes with a tool which only converts math equations. Preliminary test seems promising. Yuancheng will get an estimate of the success rate if this is run on the entire arxiv dataset.
* NTCIR math2 task:
  * This is a task where participating teams build search engine on ~100,000 arxiv papers to give results 50 queries with formulae and keywords. Some of the techniques could be helpful. 
* Copyright:
  * Grasshopper pic and DLMF usage.

## To Do:
* Create mailing list for UC & Columbia collaboration
* MeTA
  * contact MeTA team on
    * incremental index
    * multiple indices
  * add category to search-app
  * webserver on ood/dalek or Amazon for public access
  * Classification
    * work on larger dataset
    * visualize the neural network
* Demacro on entire arxiv
* LaTeXML on entire arxiv
