## Minutes:
* Multiple indicies
  * The MeTA team sent us some suggestions on how to handle multiple indices. 
  * We discussed how we might want 4 different indices, one for each of: text, equations, Content MathML, and Presentation MathML. There are some problems we will have to solve here, e.g. how to find the text which is surrounded a particular equation.
  * We plan to setup a call with the MeTA team to brainstorm.
* We have setup a basic search-engine on the arxiv data built on top of the MeTA framework:
  * This lives at http://dalek.cs.uchicago.edu:9001/
  * Some timings for 565k documents:
    * demacro: 12.5 hours
    * metadata: 5.5 hours [we can speed this up]
    * indexing: 2 hours
* Classification:
  * Hongyuan has kicked off a large-scale fit of the equation classifier.
  * Talked about visualizing equations
  * Discussed how it would be interesting to combine abstract + equations and see if we can beat the abstract-only classifier. 
* Yuanchang has been converting arxiv files to MathML using LaTeXML. Currently there seems to be a speed issue. 

## To Do:
* uchicago + columbia mailing list
* setup a call with MeTA team + prepare example queries and example documents.
* demacro and index pre0704 arxiv data. add this to search engine
* speed up LaTeXML
* come up with a basic "variable identification" dataset e.g. for an equation "E=mc^2," identify $m$ as a variable, and extract text referring to $m$. 
* Hongyuan will give a review of this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03520
* contact john goldsmith about 3d visualizer
