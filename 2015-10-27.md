## 10/27/2015 Minutes:
* welcome Sabyasachi
* the mailing list is setup at hopper@lists.uchicago.edu
* review MeTA skype meeting minutes
* the complete arxiv dataset has been demacro'd and indexed. some statistics after demacro-ing:
  * total # documents = 898,944 [93.2% coverage]
  * pre0704 = 333,272 [85.5% coverage]
  * post0704 = 565,672 [98.5% coverage]
* LateXML speed is 4000 papers per day. after speaking with the arXMLiv team, it doesn't sound like there's much room for improvement here aside from parallelizing
* Hongyuan reported his results with the large dataset of equations:
  * Training set: 2013, 2014
  * Test set: 2015
  * Classification accuracy with 5 categories: 76%
  * he also had two new visualizations to show us
  * investigated finding the "two closest papers" based on the RNN representation of equations but so far the results have not been great

## To Do:
* run LaTeXML on entire corpus
* fix permissions to /net/hopper
* fix author issues with metadata
* construct variable identification dataset
* explore ADS and try out UW visualization toolkits on arxiv submissions
* tasks from brainstorming:
  * conv-net on top of LSTM
  * equations + abstract LSTM together
  * equation-level LSTM (instead of paper-level)
  * instead of predicting 1 arxiv category with LSTM, try predicting all of the categories, or a vector of posterior topics from LDA
